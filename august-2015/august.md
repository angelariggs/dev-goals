####Lessons Learned:

I had planned to work on these goals while visiting family in Florida. I definitely overestimated the amount of time that I'd have free to work on coding! The biggest hurdle was having to plan and prep for a possible hurricane - getting my grandparents' house ready, running errands for supplies, and spending way too long on the phone changing my flights to beat the weather. I was able to futz around with v2 a little, but didn't come close to getting my goals done this week.
