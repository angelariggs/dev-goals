##Goal Tracker

As I begin my career as a developer, I'm trying to set goals to keep myself structured, inspired, and  learning new things. Inspired by my [Twitter pal Cecy](https://twitter.com/cecycorrea), I'm open-sourcing my goals as I track them, to help with accountability and share my ideas.

###Overall Goals

These are general goals that I want to meet as I continue through my career.

* **Work with kids/youth and code:** Coding should be accessible to everyone, and I believe it's important to offer that access early. I will achieve this by making myself available as a mentor, possibly through [Log Camp](https://www.logcamp.org/get-involved/for-teachers).
* **Be a part of the tech community:** I will achieve this by continuing to write about my experiences on my website, and submitting articles as a guest writer to blogs such as A List Apart and The Pastry Box. 
* **Be a voice for women in tech:** I will achieve this by getting involved with local groups for women in tech, and making myself available as a resource to women who are considering a career in development.

###2015 Goals

I want to sharpen my overall JavaScript skills, especially in relation to front-end development, and get familiar with other languages and techniques to broaden my skillset. 

Before 2015 ends, I will:

* [ ] Complete the PHP track on Treehouse
* [ ] Complete the Advanced Front-End course at Portland Code School
* [ ] Add an MVC piece to my portfolio (Angular or Ember)
* [ ] Submit a post to The Pastry Box or other tech blog

####Weekly Tasks:

* Complete one kata from Codewars
* Complete 10 hours of coursework on Treehouse

###Monthly Goals:

###September 2015: PHP Focus

*Update: My internship was pushed back to October, so my goals for September have been tweaked.* 
With a whole month to myself, I want to make sure I keep improving my foundation, and also add new skills. I learned Backbone in my JS Immersion course, but I'd like more practice with MVCs. I like the Treehouse courses for this, because I'll end up with work that I can add to my portfolio.

* [ ] Complete the [PHP Track](http://teamtreehouse.com/tracks/php-development) on Treehouse
* [ ] Complete the [AngularJS](http://teamtreehouse.com/library/angularjs) course on Treehouse
* [ ] Complete the [Ember.js](http://teamtreehouse.com/library/emberjs) course on Treehouse
* [ ] Begin the [Advanced Front-End](http://www.portlandcodeschool.com/advancedfe/) Course at Portland Code School

###October 2015: Drupal / PHP Focus

In October, I start a 2-month internship at a local Drupal agency, so I want to focus my goals in that direction. I expect that my October & November goals may change, depending on responsibilities and opportunities offered in my internship.

* [ ] Complete a Wordpress.org website
* [ ] Complete the [Drupal Basics](http://teamtreehouse.com/library/drupal-basics/upcoming) course on Treehouse
* [ ] Complete the [Advanced Front-End](http://www.portlandcodeschool.com/advancedfe/) Course at Portland Code School

###November 2015: Ruby on Rails Focus

I see a lot of job listings requesting experience in Ruby on Rails/JavaScript, and I want to broaden my skills in a direction that makes me more eligible for dev jobs in Portland.

* [ ] Complete [Ruby on Rails](http://teamtreehouse.com/tracks/rails-development) course on Treehouse
* [ ] Complete various [Ruby on Rails workshops](http://teamtreehouse.com/library/q:rails) on Treehouse

###December 2015:
