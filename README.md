##Goal Tracker

As I begin my career as a developer, I'm trying to set goals to keep myself structured, inspired, and  learning new things. Inspired by my [Twitter pal Cecy](https://twitter.com/cecycorrea), I'm open-sourcing my goals as I track them, to help with accountability and share my ideas.

###Overall Goals

These are general goals that I want to meet as I continue through my career.

* **Work with kids/youth and code:** Coding should be accessible to everyone, and I believe it's important to offer that access early. I will achieve this by making myself available as a mentor, possibly through [Log Camp](https://www.logcamp.org/get-involved/for-teachers).
* **Be a part of the tech community:** I will achieve this by continuing to write about my experiences on my website, and submitting articles as a guest writer to blogs such as A List Apart and The Pastry Box. 
* **Be a voice for women in tech:** I will achieve this by getting involved with local groups for women in tech, and making myself available as a resource to women who are considering a career in development.

###2015 Goals

I want to sharpen my overall JavaScript skills, especially in relation to front-end development, and get familiar with other languages and techniques to broaden my skillset. 

Before 2015 ends, I will:

* [ ] Complete the PHP track on Treehouse
* [ ] Complete the Advanced Front-End course at Portland Code School
* [ ] Add an MVC piece to my portfolio (Angular or Ember)
* [x] Submit a post to The Pastry Box or other tech blog: [Metal Toad Blog](http://www.metaltoad.com/blog/interns-instantaneous-toadness-internship)
