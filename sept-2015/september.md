## Monthly Goals

* [ ] Complete the [PHP Track](http://teamtreehouse.com/tracks/php-development) on Treehouse
* [ ] Continue the [Front-End Track](http://teamtreehouse.com/tracks/front-end-web-development) on Treehouse

### Week of 08/30

* [x] Complete 10 hours of Treehouse PHP Track
* [ ] Complete one kata from Codewars

####Successes:
I really enjoyed getting started in PHP! There are enough similarities to JavaScript that I feel confident in my ability to move quickly through the beginning courses; but it's different enough that I'm staying interested and having fun experimenting beyond the basics.

####Lessons Learned:
I don't know that anything really went wrong this week. I had some social things planned that cut into my coding time, and I realize that I need to be firmer with myself about setting time limits and sticking to them.
